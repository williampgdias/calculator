# Calculator

The main goal was to practice javascript functions.
It was used querySelector to select the buttons, if, else and it can change to dark or light theme.

I built this project few months ago, but I used many lines of code for it. 
I did again with a different tutorial and found that better, because it is "simpler" and used less lines of code. :sweat_smile:
